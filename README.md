# About
I made this app for my final year project for A-levels. The main feature of this app is for messaging amongst a team within a business. Managers have certain features that staff do not have. The app aims to improve productivity levels of a business by cutting/lowering any unnecessary activity that happens in a business by integrating some face-to-face events to be executed on the app, as well as store data of staff activity, in order to give a more accurate feedback to staff by their seniors. This is what segregates my app design from other popular apps such as slack or microsoft teams.

## Built with
So far this app is built on a local network system, however with a few adjustments this could be easily live and running at any business. Nevertheless, the core technologies used for this app is:
* Python
* PyQt
* SQLite
